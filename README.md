This is a basic blog website. React is used in the frontend & for backend i use Laravel php framework (Version 5.7).

## Installing Process in localhost:

For php i'm using xampp.

- Paste `server` folder  in your htdocs folder
- Run `php artisan serve` from server folder. Make sure your laravel project is on
- make a database with the name of `blog-react` And run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` command.
